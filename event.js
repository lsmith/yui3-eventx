/**
Collection of behaviors for subscribing to and firing a named custom event.
This class is meant to be a scaffolding for customizations. The default
method implementations support the following customizations:

* config.defaultFn(e) - Behavior executed after `on()` subscribers, before
    `after()` subscribers, and only if `e.preventDefault()` isn't called.
* config.preventable (boolean) - If `e.preventDefault()` does anything.
* config.preventedFn(e) - Called if `e.preventDefault()` is called.
* config.stoppedFn(e) - Called if `e.stopPropagation()` is called.
* config.bubbles (boolean) - Allow or disallow bubbling for this event. Default
    is `true`.
* config.allowDups (boolean) - Allow or disallow duplicate subscriptions.
    Default is `true`.
* config.on(target, subscription, details) - Execute this code when
    subscriptions are made to the event. Return truthy value to abort the
    subscription. Return a different Subscription to avoid registering the one
    passed in.
* config.detach(target, subscription) - Likewise when subscriptions are removed
* config.parseSignature(target, subArgs, details) - Support custom subscription
    signatures. Add additional data to the _details_ object to store in the
    subscription object's `details` property.
* config.publish(target) - Execute this code when the event is published.
* config.Event(type, target, payload) - Class used to create the event objects
    that are passed to subscribers.
* config.Subscription(target, args, details) - Class used to encapsulate a
    subscription to the event.

Additional properties and methods can be added to the event for reference from
any of the configured methods, or from overrides to the methods defined on the
CustomEvent prototype. All properties of the _config_ object are mixed onto
the event.

The primary use case for custom event creation is through static definition
on a class in the `EventTarget.configure()` call. More events can be added to
a class or specifically to a class instance using either the class's static or
instance `publish()` method.

```
Y.EventTarget.configure(MyClass, { map of events to configs }, defaultEvent);

MyClass.publish('eventX', { bubbles: false });

instance.publish('eventY', { preventable: false });
```

Events published on a class or instance derive their behavior from a default
event defined during `configure()`. The default event is a custom event whose
configured behaviors are used when `on()` or `fire()` are called for events
that aren't explicitly published for the class or instance. To create an event
that derives from a different set of event behaviors, pass the desired
prototype event as _inheritsFrom_.

@class CustomEvent

    Typically defined events will not need to override this method.  The
    arguments array received as the third parameter is passed to the
    `parseSignature` method for any adjustments needed.  The methods
    called from here include:
    
    * `parseSignature(target, args, subDetails)` if defined for this event
    * `new this.Subscription(target, args, subDetails)` passing the
       processed argument array and subscription metadata, augmented with any

    * `isSubscribed(target, sub)` if `preventDups` is truthy
    * `on(target, sub)` if `on` is defined for this event
    
    The default signature of `args` for direct subscriptions is:
    * type (string)
    * callback (function)
    * thisObj (optional `this` override for callback)
    * ...argN (optional additional bound subscription args to pass to callback)

    The default signature of `args` for delegate subscriptions is:
    * type (string)
    * callback (function)
    * filter (function)
    * thisObj (optional `this` override for callback)
    * ...argN (optional additional bound subscription args to pass to callback)
    
    The _details_ object contains instructions and/or information for how to
    create or customize the subscription. The default properties looked for are:
    * phase (string) - which phase to register the subscription in
    * delegate (boolean) - do _args_ reflect a delegate signature
    * once (boolean) - should the subscription auto-detach after notification

    /**
    Publishes an event for all instances of a class.

    This method is added to EventTarget subclasses by
    `EventTarget.configure(MyClass,...)`.

    Define specific behavioral overrides from the class's default event in the
    _config_ object. If the event doesn't have special behavior, it is not
    necessary to publish it.

    If an event should behave like an event other than the default event, pass
    that CustomEvent object as _inheritsFrom_. _config_ overrides will be
    applied over the inherited event's behaviors. If no overrides are
    necessary, just pass the CustomEvent as _config_ and omit _inheritsFrom_.

    If an event should be registered as a smart event rather than published as
    a standalone event, include the _smart_ parameter. Pass an array of the
    lifecycle phases that you want the event listening for. Available phases:

    * "subscribe" (handles both direct and delegate subscriptions)
    * "unsubscribe"
    * "fire"

    Smart events must have a method `test(target, argsArray, method)` that
    should return true if control should be routed to that event's appropriate
    method. E.g. this event will route subscriptions for 'itemClick#some-id'
    to the 'itemClick' event with a filtering callback that will only call the
    subscribed callback if the clicked item's id matches the id from the
    subscription. It will not intercept `fire` or `unsubscribe`.

    ```
    // Handle subscriptions like menu.on('itemClick#upload', callback)
    Y.Menu.publish('@itemClick', {
        test: function (target, args) {
            return args[0].indexOf('itemClick#') === 0;
        },

        parseSignature: function (target, args, details) {
            var itemId   = args[0].slice(args[0].indexOf('#') + 1),
                callback = args[1],
                sub;

            // transform this into a delegate subscription
            details.delegate = true;
            details.itemId   = itemId;

            args[0] = 'itemClick';
            args.splice(2, 0, this.filter);
        },

        filter: function (e) {
            return (e.currentTarget.id === e.subscription.details.itemId);
        }
    }, null, ['subscribe']);
    ```

    multiple events at once.

    by default the subscription signature will look like this:

    ```
    target.subscribe(type, phase, callback, thisObj, ...argN);
    ```

    _thisObj_ is optional, and sets the _callback_'s `this` object. The default
    `this` object in the callback is `target`, the object from which `on()` was
    called. Arguments beyond _thisObj_ will be passed to the callback after the
    event object generated by `fire()`.
    
    If no event published for this class or instance matches the type string
    exactly, smart events will be tested if any have been published for this
    class or instance. If either no smart events have been published or none
    match the subscription signature, the default event behavior will be used.

    _phase_ may be a string (e.g. "on" or "after") or a configuration
    object containing any of the following properties:
    * "phase" - (required) Typically "on" or "after", but may be custom
    * "once" - Truthy if the subscription should be detached after notification
    * "delegate" - Truthy if the args correspond to a delegate signature

    Use an object config to create special subscriptions, such as one-time
    delegated subscriptions in non-"on" phases:

    ```
    var subConfig = {
        phase: 'in-between',
        delegate: true,
        once: true
    };

    target.subscribe('crazy', subConfig, callback, delegateFilter, thisObj);
    ```
    Since CustomEvents may have overridden `subscribe` methods, additional
    config properties may be passed to trigger custom behavior or provide info
    for custom behavior.
